# Milestone M01: Foundation & Tesla Integration

**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ PLANNED  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

Establish the foundational architecture for VolTracker's cross-platform development and implement core Tesla vehicle integration. This milestone sets up the development environment, authentication systems, and basic vehicle connectivity required for all subsequent features.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Multi-Platform Foundation**: Complete React Native + Web setup with shared architecture
2. **Authentication Systems**: Implement both user auth (Supabase) and Tesla OAuth integration  
3. **Tesla Connectivity**: Establish reliable connection to Tesla Fleet API
4. **Development Workflow**: Create sustainable development and deployment processes

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All three platforms (iOS, Android, Web) building and running
- âœ… Users can authenticate and connect their Tesla account
- âœ… App successfully retrieves basic vehicle information
- âœ… Core navigation and shared components operational
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline functional for all platforms

## Sprint Breakdown

### S01: Environment & Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)
**Focus:** Project foundation and development environment

**Key Deliverables:**
- React Native project with TypeScript and Web support
- Multi-platform build configuration (iOS/Android/Web)
- Supabase backend setup with database schema
- Core navigation structure and shared components
- Development environment and tooling configuration

### S02: Authentication & Tesla Integration (Week 3-4)  
**Focus:** User and vehicle authentication systems

**Key Deliverables:**
- Supabase email authentication flow
- Tesla OAuth implementation for all platforms
- Vehicle selection and management interface
- Secure token storage and session management
- Basic vehicle data display and connectivity verification

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support
- **iOS**: Minimum iOS 12+, built with React Native
- **Android**: Minimum API 21+, built with React Native  
- **Web**: Modern browsers, built with React Native Web
- **Shared Codebase**: 85-90% code reuse target

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Tesla Integration**: Tesla Fleet API access
- **Development**: Node.js, React Native CLI, platform SDKs
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Vercel/Netlify (web), app stores (mobile)

### Security Requirements
- OAuth 2.0 implementation for Tesla integration
- Secure credential storage per platform
- Database Row Level Security policies
- Environment variable management

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Tesla Fleet API application approval and credentials
- App store developer accounts (iOS/Android)
- Domain registration and SSL certificates

### Potential Blockers
- Tesla API approval delays
- Platform-specific build issues
- Cross-platform navigation complexities
- OAuth redirect handling differences
