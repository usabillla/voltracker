# Sprint S01: Performance Optimization

## Sprint Goal

Optimize mobile performance to achieve Core Web Vitals targets and improve user experience through faster loading times and efficient asset delivery.

## Sprint Scope

Focus on technical performance improvements that directly impact user acquisition and mobile experience metrics.

## Key Deliverables

### Image Optimization & Lazy Loading
- Implement intersection observer-based lazy loading for all images
- Add next-generation image format support (WebP/AVIF with PNG fallbacks)
- Optimize existing images for multiple screen densities

### Core Web Vitals Optimization  
- Achieve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s on mobile
- Maintain FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
- Keep CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- Target Mobile PageSpeed Score > 90

### Asset & Caching Optimization
- Implement proper cache headers for static assets
- Optimize CSS delivery and reduce render-blocking resources
- Minimize and optimize JavaScript bundles

### Performance Monitoring
- Set up performance monitoring and alerting
- Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- Establish performance baseline metrics

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All images implement lazy loading with proper fallbacks
- [ ] WebP/AVIF formats implemented with PNG fallbacks
- [ ] Core Web Vitals meet target thresholds on mobile
- [ ] Mobile PageSpeed Score achieves 90+ rating
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard established
- [ ] Cache headers optimized for static assets
- [ ] Performance improvements validated on real devices

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **LCP:** < 2.5s on mobile (current baseline: TBD)
- **FID:** < 100ms (current baseline: TBD)  
- **CLS:** < 0.1 (current baseline: TBD)
- **Mobile PageSpeed:** > 90 (current baseline: TBD)

### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3s
- **Mobile bounce rate:** < 40%
- **Page load completion:** 95% within 5s

## Technical Dependencies

- Performance testing tools and metrics baseline
- Image optimization toolchain
- CDN configuration access (Vercel)
- Mobile device testing capability

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk:** Performance changes breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Implement changes incrementally with rollback capability

- **Risk:** Image optimization affecting visual quality
- **Mitigation:** A/B test with quality metrics and user feedback
