# Sprint S01: Environment & Infrastructure Setup

## Overview
Establish foundational project infrastructure and development environment for VolTracker multi-platform application.

## Sprint Goals
- React Native project with TypeScript and Web support ✅
- Multi-platform build configuration (iOS/Android/Web) ✅
- Supabase backend setup with database schema ✅
- Core navigation structure and shared components ✅
- Development environment and tooling configuration ✅

## Deliverables
1. **Cross-Platform Foundation**: React Native + React Native Web architecture ✅
2. **Backend Infrastructure**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS security ✅
3. **Build System**: Multi-platform build configurations ✅
4. **Navigation Framework**: Custom navigation system implementation ✅
5. **Development Tools**: Environment setup and documentation ✅

## Implementation Status
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-02
**Overall Progress**: 100% Complete

### Completed Components
- ✅ React Native 0.79.2 with TypeScript
- ✅ React Native Web integration via Webpack
- ✅ iOS/Android build configurations
- ✅ Supabase client and database schema
- ✅ Custom navigation system (replaced React Navigation due to webpack conflicts)
- ✅ Comprehensive shared component library with theme system
- ✅ Environment variable management with cross-platform support
- ✅ Development environment fully configured and tested
- ✅ Browser compatibility issues resolved

## Completed Tasks
1. **T01_S01_React_Navigation_Setup.md** - ✅ Implemented custom navigation system
2. **T02_S01_Environment_Variables.md** - ✅ Cross-platform environment management
3. **T03_S01_Shared_Component_Library.md** - ✅ Theme system and UI components
4. **T04_S01_Development_Documentation.md** - ✅ Development setup and configuration

## Dependencies
- Node.js and React Native CLI setup
- Supabase project configuration
- Platform SDKs (iOS/Android)
- Development environment access

## Success Metrics ✅
- ✅ All platforms build and run successfully (iOS/Android/Web)
- ✅ Navigation flows work across platforms with custom system
- ✅ Database connectivity established via Supabase
- ✅ Development environment fully functional with webpack dev server
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured across platforms
- ✅ Shared component library operational with theme system
- ✅ Browser compatibility issues resolved (process.env fix)

## Sprint Retrospective
**What Went Well:**
- Successfully implemented cross-platform foundation
- Custom navigation solution avoided React Navigation webpack conflicts
- Comprehensive shared component library with consistent theming
- Environment variable system works seamlessly across platforms

**Challenges Overcome:**
- React Navigation webpack v7 compatibility issues → Custom navigation solution
- Browser environment variable access → DefinePlugin webpack configuration
- Cross-platform component consistency → Shared theme system

**Key Learnings:**
- Custom solutions sometimes outperform complex libraries for specific use cases
- Environment variable handling requires platform-specific approaches
- Webpack configuration crucial for React Native Web compatibility

**Handoff to S02:**
- All infrastructure components ready for authentication implementation
- Navigation system prepared for auth flow integration
- Environment system configured for Tesla API credentials
- Component library available for building auth screens
