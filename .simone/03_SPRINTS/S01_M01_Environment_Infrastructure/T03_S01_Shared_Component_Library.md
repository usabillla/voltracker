# Task: Shared Component Library

## Description
Create a foundational shared UI component library that provides consistent, reusable components across all platforms (web, iOS, Android). Currently, the app has duplicate styling patterns and inline component definitions across screens, leading to inconsistent user experience and maintenance overhead. This task will establish a design system foundation with core components that handle platform-responsive design and theming.

Analysis of existing codebase reveals:
- Inconsistent styling patterns across LoginScreen, DashboardScreen, and TeslaCallback
- Duplicate color scheme handling (dark/light mode) in every component
- Repeated button, input, and layout patterns without shared abstraction
- Manual style object creation with theme logic scattered throughout components
- No standardized spacing, typography, or color system

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a comprehensive shared component library that:
- Provides consistent UI/UX across all platforms
- Implements responsive design patterns for web, iOS, and Android
- Centralizes theming and styling logic
- Reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Enables rapid feature development with reusable components
- Establishes design system foundations for scalability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core component library created in `/src/components/shared/` with proper exports
- [ ] Theme system implemented with centralized color, typography, and spacing tokens
- [ ] Platform-responsive components that adapt to web, iOS, and Android contexts
- [ ] Form components (Button, Input, TextArea) with consistent styling and behavior
- [ ] Layout components (Container, Card, Screen) with standardized spacing and responsive design
- [ ] Loading state components (Spinner, ProgressBar) with platform-appropriate indicators
- [ ] Typography components (Heading, Text, Caption) with consistent hierarchy
- [ ] Icon system with platform-appropriate icons and consistent sizing
- [ ] All existing screens refactored to use shared components
- [ ] Component documentation with usage examples and props interface
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all component props
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Performance optimized with proper memoization and lazy loading

## Subtasks
- [ ] **Theme System Setup**
  - [ ] Create theme provider and context (`/src/theme/`)
  - [ ] Define color tokens (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, neutral scales)
  - [ ] Define typography scale (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - [ ] Define spacing system (margins, paddings, gaps)
  - [ ] Implement dark/light mode switching logic
  - [ ] Add platform-specific theme variations

- [ ] **Core Layout Components**
  - [ ] `Screen` - Root screen wrapper with safe area handling
  - [ ] `Container` - Content container with responsive max-width and padding
  - [ ] `Card` - Elevated content container with consistent shadows/borders
  - [ ] `Stack` - Vertical layout component with configurable spacing
  - [ ] `Row` - Horizontal layout component with configurable spacing
  - [ ] `Spacer` - Flexible space component for layouts

- [ ] **Form Components**
  - [ ] `Button` - Primary, secondary, and outline variants with loading states
  - [ ] `IconButton` - Icon-only button with accessibility support
  - [ ] `Input` - Text input with validation states and platform-specific styling
  - [ ] `TextArea` - Multi-line text input with auto-resize capabilities
  - [ ] `Checkbox` - Custom checkbox with platform-appropriate styling
  - [ ] `Switch` - Toggle switch component
  - [ ] `Select` - Dropdown/picker component with platform-specific implementations

- [ ] **Feedback Components**
  - [ ] `LoadingSpinner` - Activity indicator with size variants
  - [ ] `ProgressBar` - Linear progress indicator
  - [ ] `Alert` - Inline alert/notification component
  - [ ] `Toast` - Temporary notification system
  - [ ] `Modal` - Modal/dialog component with backdrop
  - [ ] `StatusIndicator` - Connection status, loading states, etc.

- [ ] **Typography Components**
  - [ ] `Heading` - H1-H6 heading variants with consistent hierarchy
  - [ ] `Text` - Body text with size and weight variants
  - [ ] `Caption` - Small text for labels and descriptions
  - [ ] `Link` - Styled link component with press states

- [ ] **Icon System**
  - [ ] Icon component with size and color props
  - [ ] Platform-specific icon mappings (Ionicons, Material Icons)
  - [ ] Consistent icon sizing and alignment
  - [ ] Common icon set definition (chevron, check, x, plus, etc.)

- [ ] **Platform Responsiveness**
  - [ ] Web-specific styling enhancements (hover states, cursor styles)
  - [ ] Mobile-specific touch targets and gestures
  - [ ] Responsive breakpoint system for web layouts
  - [ ] Platform-specific component behaviors

- [ ] **Component Integration**
  - [ ] Refactor `LoginScreen` to use shared components
  - [ ] Refactor `DashboardScreen` to use shared components
  - [ ] Refactor `TeslaCallback` to use shared components
  - [ ] Update component exports in `/src/components/index.ts`
  - [ ] Remove duplicate styling patterns from screens

- [ ] **Documentation & Testing**
  - [ ] Create component usage documentation
  - [ ] Add prop interfaces and TypeScript definitions
  - [ ] Create component examples/stories
  - [ ] Add accessibility testing and screen reader support
  - [ ] Performance testing and optimization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Structure
```typescript
interface Theme {
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
    background: string;
    surface: string;
    text: string;
    textSecondary: string;
    border: string;
    success: string;
    warning: string;
    error: string;
  };
  typography: {
    heading1: TextStyle;
    heading2: TextStyle;
    body: TextStyle;
    caption: TextStyle;
  };
  spacing: {
    xs: number;
    sm: number;
    md: number;
    lg: number;
    xl: number;
  };
  borderRadius: {
    sm: number;
    md: number;
    lg: number;
  };
}
```

### Component Architecture
- Each component should accept theme-aware props
- Platform-specific implementations using `platformSelect` utility
- Consistent prop interfaces across similar components
- Forward ref support for form components
- Memoization for performance optimization

### Platform Considerations
- **Web**: Hover states, cursor styles, responsive breakpoints
- **iOS**: Native iOS design patterns, safe area handling
- **Android**: Material Design principles, elevation shadows
- **Universal**: Touch targets, accessibility, keyboard navigation
