# Task: Production Monitoring & Analytics Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive production monitoring, error reporting, and analytics infrastructure to ensure visibility into application health, performance, and user behavior in production environments. This task focuses on establishing production-grade observability across both React Native mobile and web platforms, building upon the existing error handling foundation to create a robust monitoring ecosystem.

The implementation will integrate with the current security-focused error handling system (errorHandling.ts) and extend monitoring capabilities across the cross-platform architecture. This monitoring infrastructure is critical for maintaining production system reliability and enabling data-driven product decisions.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish comprehensive production monitoring that enables proactive identification of issues, performance optimization, and user behavior insights across all platforms.

- Implement error reporting and tracking system with privacy-conscious data collection
- Establish performance monitoring for both mobile and web platforms
- Integrate user analytics to understand application usage patterns
- Create health check and alerting infrastructure for production systems
- Build monitoring dashboards for operational visibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error reporting system captures and categorizes errors across all platforms with sensitive data protection
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracks application metrics, load times, and resource usage
- [ ] User analytics provides insights into feature usage and user journeys while respecting privacy
- [ ] Health checks monitor system availability and automatically alert on failures
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards provide real-time visibility into application health and performance
- [ ] All monitoring integrations work consistently across React Native (iOS/Android) and web platforms
- [ ] Production monitoring is operational and generating actionable insights

## Subtasks

### Phase 1: Error Reporting Integration
- [ ] Research and select error reporting service (Sentry vs Bugsnag vs alternatives)
- [ ] Install and configure error reporting SDK for React Native and web platforms
- [ ] Integrate with existing errorHandling.ts security patterns
- [ ] Configure error filtering and sensitive data protection
- [ ] Set up error categorization and alerting rules
- [ ] Test error reporting across all platforms (iOS, Android, web)
- [ ] Document error reporting configuration and best practices

### Phase 2: Performance Monitoring Implementation  
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for web platform (Core Web Vitals, load times)
- [ ] Add React Native performance monitoring (app startup, navigation, memory usage)
- [ ] Configure performance alerting thresholds and notifications
- [ ] Set up performance regression detection and tracking
- [ ] Integrate with existing platform.ts utilities for cross-platform metrics
- [ ] Create performance baseline measurements for comparison
- [ ] Document performance monitoring setup and interpretation

### Phase 3: User Analytics Integration
- [ ] Select privacy-focused analytics solution (respecting user privacy)
- [ ] Implement user journey tracking for key application flows
- [ ] Add feature usage analytics for dashboard insights
- [ ] Configure conversion funnel tracking (signup, Tesla integration, etc.)
- [ ] Set up user retention and engagement metrics
- [ ] Implement privacy controls and user consent management
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for product insights

### Phase 4: Health Checks & Alerting
- [ ] Implement application health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up Vercel/hosting platform monitoring integration
- [ ] Configure automated uptime monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create service dependency health checks (Supabase, Tesla API)
- [ ] Implement synthetic transaction monitoring for critical user flows
- [ ] Set up incident response procedures and escalation paths
- [ ] Document health check and alerting configuration

### Phase 5: Monitoring Dashboards & Documentation
- [ ] Create unified monitoring dashboard combining all metrics
- [ ] Set up operational runbooks for common monitoring scenarios
- [ ] Document monitoring best practices and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Create monitoring data retention and archival policies
- [ ] Implement monitoring infrastructure backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Validate monitoring effectiveness through simulated issues
- [ ] Conduct team training on monitoring tools and procedures

## Technical Implementation Guidance

### Error Reporting Architecture
```typescript
// Extend existing errorHandling.ts patterns
interface ProductionErrorReport {
  errorId: string;
  message: string;
  stack?: string; // Sanitized
  platform: 'web' | 'ios' | 'android';
  userId?: string; // Hashed for privacy
  buildVersion: string;
  context: {
    screen?: string;
    action?: string;
    metadata: Record<string, any>; // Sanitized
  };
}

// Integration with existing createSafeError function
export function reportProductionError(
  error: Error | unknown,
  context?: ErrorContext
): void {
  const safeError = createSafeError(error);
  // Send to error reporting service with privacy protection
}
```

### Cross-Platform Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Platform-specific performance tracking
export const performanceTracker = {
  web: {
    trackPageLoad: (page: string) => void,
    trackCoreWebVitals: () => void,
    trackUserInteraction: (action: string) => void,
  },
  mobile: {
    trackAppStartup: () => void,
    trackNavigationPerformance: (screen: string) => void,
    trackMemoryUsage: () => void,
  }
};

// Unified performance reporting
export function reportPerformanceMetric(
  metric: string,
  value: number,
  platform: Platform
): void;
```

### Analytics Privacy Framework
```typescript
// Privacy-first analytics implementation
export interface AnalyticsEvent {
  event: string;
  properties: Record<string, any>; // No PII
  timestamp: number;
  sessionId: string; // Anonymous
  platform: Platform;
}

export function trackUserAction(
  action: string,
  properties?: Record<string, any>
): void {
  // Ensure no sensitive data in properties
  const sanitizedProps = sanitizeAnalyticsData(properties);
  // Send to analytics service
}
```

### Health Check Infrastructure
```typescript
// Health check endpoints and monitoring
export interface HealthCheckResult {
  service: string;
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  latency?: number;
  error?: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

export async function performHealthChecks(): Promise<HealthCheckResult[]> {
  return Promise.all([
    checkSupabaseConnection(),
    checkTeslaAPIAccess(),
    checkDatabaseConnection(),
    checkExternalDependencies(),
  ]);
}
```

### Monitoring Integration Points
- **Vercel Deployment**: Leverage Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals integration
- **React Native**: Integrate with React Native performance monitoring tools
- **Supabase**: Monitor database performance and connection health
- **Tesla API**: Track API response times and error rates
- **User Authentication**: Monitor authentication success/failure rates

### Privacy and Security Considerations
- Implement data minimization principles in all monitoring
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for user data collection
- Use data hashing/anonymization for user identifiers
- Implement user consent management for analytics
- Regular security reviews of monitoring data handling
- Secure storage and transmission of monitoring data

### Recommended Monitoring Stack
- **Error Reporting**: Sentry (React Native + Web support, privacy features)
- **Performance**: Sentry Performance + Vercel Analytics (web), React Native Performance
- **Analytics**: PostHog (privacy-focused) or Mixpanel (with privacy controls)
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Uptime Robot or Pingdom
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel monitoring + custom health checks
