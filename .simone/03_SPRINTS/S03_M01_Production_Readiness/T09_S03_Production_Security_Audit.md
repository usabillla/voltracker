# T05a_S03_Production_Security_Audit

## Task Overview
**Task ID:** T05a_S03_Production_Security_Audit  
**Sprint:** S03  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days  

## Description
Comprehensive security audit and hardening of the VolTracker application for production deployment. This task focuses on identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities, implementing security best practices, and ensuring the application meets production security standards.

## Scope
- Security review and vulnerability assessment
- Production security hardening
- Authentication and authorization security validation
- Data protection and encryption verification
- API security assessment
- Third-party dependency security audit

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Security audit completed with documented findings
- [ ] All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Production security hardening measures implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization systems validated
- [ ] Data encryption and protection verified
- [ ] API security measures validated
- [ ] Third-party dependencies security reviewed
- [ ] Security documentation updated

## Technical Requirements

### Security Assessment Areas
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Tesla OAuth flow security
   - JWT token handling and validation
   - Session management security
   - Role-based access control validation

2. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data encryption (at rest and in transit)
   - Secure storage implementation validation
   - Data masking and sanitization
   - PII protection compliance

3. **API Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - CORS configuration validation
   - API endpoint security assessment

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Environment configuration security
   - Secrets management validation
   - HTTPS/TLS configuration
   - Security headers implementation

5. **Third-party Dependencies**
   - npm audit and vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency license compliance
   - Supply chain security assessment

### Security Tools and Scanning
- Run automated security scans (npm audit, etc.)
- Perform manual code review for security issues
- Validate environment configuration security
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Verify encryption implementation

## Dependencies
- None (independent security audit task)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Security audit report completed with findings categorized by severity
2. All critical vulnerabilities resolved
3. High-severity vulnerabilities addressed or documented with mitigation plans
4. Security hardening measures implemented and documented
5. Authentication and authorization flows validated
6. Data encryption and protection verified
7. API security measures validated and tested
8. Security documentation updated with current measures

## Deliverables
- [ ] Security audit report with findings and recommendations
- [ ] Vulnerability assessment document
- [ ] Security hardening implementation documentation
- [ ] Updated security configuration files
- [ ] Security test results and validation reports
- [ ] Updated security documentation

## Notes
- Focus on production-ready security measures
- Document all security findings and remediation steps
- Ensure compliance with security best practices
- Validate all security configurations before marking complete
