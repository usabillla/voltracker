# Task: T01a_S03_useTesla_Hook_Testing

## Overview
**Sprint:** S03 - Core Business Logic Testing  
**Task ID:** T01a_S03_useTesla_Hook_Testing  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started  

## Description
Comprehensive testing implementation for the useTesla hook, which is the core business logic component for vehicle management functionality. This task focuses specifically on testing the main hook that manages Tesla vehicle data, authentication, and state management.

## Scope
- **Focus Area:** useTesla hook comprehensive testing (Phase 1 from original T01_S03_Core_Business_Logic_Testing)
- **Components:** `/src/hooks/useTesla.ts`
- **Test Type:** Unit testing with comprehensive coverage
- **Success Criteria:** 90%+ coverage for useTesla hook

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete useTesla Hook Testing**
   - [ ] Test all hook return values and state management
   - [ ] Test vehicle data fetching and caching
   - [ ] Test error handling and retry logic
   - [ ] Test authentication token management
   - [ ] Test vehicle selection and state updates
   - [ ] Test loading states and transitions

2. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - [ ] Test network failures and timeouts
   - [ ] Test invalid token scenarios
   - [ ] Test empty vehicle lists
   - [ ] Test concurrent request handling
   - [ ] Test hook cleanup and unmounting

3. **Integration Points**
   - [ ] Test Tesla service integration
   - [ ] Test secure storage integration
   - [ ] Test authentication hook integration

4. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Test hook performance with large vehicle datasets
   - [ ] Test memory leak prevention
   - [ ] Test proper cleanup of subscriptions

## Technical Requirements
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for useTesla hook
- Use React Testing Library for hook testing
- Mock all external dependencies appropriately
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Ensure all async operations are properly tested

## Dependencies
- Existing useTesla hook implementation
- React Testing Library setup
- Jest testing framework
- Mock implementations for Tesla service and secure storage

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive test suite for useTesla hook (`__tests__/hooks/useTesla.test.ts`)
2. Mock implementations for testing dependencies
3. Test coverage report showing 90%+ coverage
4. Documentation of test scenarios and edge cases

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved for useTesla hook
- [ ] All edge cases and error scenarios tested
- [ ] Integration points properly mocked and tested
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes
This task is split from the original T01_S03_Core_Business_Logic_Testing to focus specifically on the most critical business logic component - the useTesla hook. This hook is central to the application's vehicle management functionality and requires thorough testing to ensure reliability.

## Estimation
**Effort:** 8-12 hours  
**Timeline:** 2-3 days
