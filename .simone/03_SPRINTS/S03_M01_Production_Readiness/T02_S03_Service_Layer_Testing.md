# Task: T01b_S03_Service_Layer_Testing

## Overview
**Sprint:** S03 - Core Business Logic Testing  
**Task ID:** T01b_S03_Service_Layer_Testing  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started  

## Description
Comprehensive testing implementation for the service layer components including Tesla service, Authentication service, and SecureStorage service. This task ensures all service layer business logic is thoroughly tested with proper error handling and edge case coverage.

## Scope
- **Focus Area:** Service layer comprehensive testing (Phases 2-4 from original T01_S03_Core_Business_Logic_Testing)
- **Components:** 
  - `/src/services/tesla.ts`
  - `/src/services/auth.ts`
  - `/src/services/secureStorage.ts`
- **Test Type:** Unit and integration testing
- **Success Criteria:** 90%+ coverage for all service components

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Tesla Service Testing**
   - [ ] Test OAuth flow initiation and completion
   - [ ] Test token refresh mechanisms
   - [ ] Test vehicle data fetching
   - [ ] Test API rate limiting handling
   - [ ] Test error responses and retry logic
   - [ ] Test vehicle command execution
   - [ ] Test data transformation and validation

2. **Authentication Service Testing**
   - [ ] Test user login/logout functionality
   - [ ] Test token validation and refresh
   - [ ] Test session management
   - [ ] Test password reset functionality
   - [ ] Test user registration flow
   - [ ] Test authentication state persistence
   - [ ] Test security token handling

3. **SecureStorage Service Testing**
   - [ ] Test secure storage operations (get/set/delete)
   - [ ] Test encryption/decryption of sensitive data
   - [ ] Test storage key management
   - [ ] Test storage cleanup and migration
   - [ ] Test platform-specific storage implementations
   - [ ] Test storage error handling
   - [ ] Test storage capacity limits

4. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test service dependencies and interactions
   - [ ] Test error propagation between services
   - [ ] Test concurrent service operations
   - [ ] Test service initialization and cleanup

5. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Test network connectivity issues
   - [ ] Test API unavailability scenarios
   - [ ] Test invalid credentials handling
   - [ ] Test storage corruption scenarios
   - [ ] Test memory pressure situations
   - [ ] Test platform-specific failures

## Technical Requirements
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all service components
- Use Jest and appropriate mocking strategies
- Test both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, storage, network)
- Test error scenarios and edge cases thoroughly
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources in tests

## Dependencies
- Existing service implementations
- Jest testing framework
- Network and storage mocking utilities
- Supabase client mocking
- Tesla API mocking utilities

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive test suites:
   - `__tests__/services/tesla.test.ts` (enhanced)
   - `__tests__/services/auth.test.ts` (new)
   - `__tests__/services/secureStorage.test.ts` (new)
2. Service integration test suite
3. Mock implementations for external dependencies
4. Test coverage reports showing 90%+ coverage
5. Documentation of service testing patterns

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test cases pass for all services
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved for each service
- [ ] All error scenarios and edge cases tested
- [ ] Integration between services properly tested
- [ ] Security considerations addressed in tests
- [ ] Performance impact evaluated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Test Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** Test individual service methods in isolation
2. **Integration Tests:** Test service interactions and dependencies
3. **Error Tests:** Test all error paths and recovery mechanisms
4. **Security Tests:** Test authentication and secure storage features
5. **Performance Tests:** Test service performance under load

## Notes
This task focuses on the service layer which forms the foundation of the application's business logic. Proper testing of these services ensures reliable data management, secure authentication, and robust Tesla API integration.

## Estimation
**Effort:** 12-16 hours  
**Timeline:** 3-4 days
