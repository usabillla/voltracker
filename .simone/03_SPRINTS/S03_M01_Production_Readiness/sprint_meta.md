- Prepare app store assets (screenshots, descriptions, metadata)
- Submit applications to Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- Verify mobile OAuth redirect flows in production
- Set up app store analytics and monitoring

### ðŸ“Š Production Monitoring & Analytics
- Integrate error reporting system (Sentry/Bugsnag)
- Add performance monitoring and alerting
- Implement user analytics for production insights
- Set up production logging and debugging tools
- Configure automated health checks

### ðŸ”’ Final Production Hardening
- Conduct comprehensive security audit
- Perform load testing and performance optimization
- Final code quality review and documentation updates
- Production deployment verification and testing

## Sprint Tasks

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality Foundation (Critical Path)
- **[T01_S03_useTesla_Hook_Testing](T01_S03_useTesla_Hook_Testing.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Comprehensive test coverage for useTesla hook including OAuth flow and vehicle management
  - Critical foundation for all other tasks

- **[T02_S03_Service_Layer_Testing](T02_S03_Service_Layer_Testing.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Unit tests for Tesla service, auth service, and validation utilities
  - Depends on T01 for underlying test patterns

- **[T03_S03_Validation_Infrastructure_Testing](T03_S03_Validation_Infrastructure_Testing.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Test coverage for validation utilities, error handling, and security functions
  - Can run in parallel with T01/T02

- **[T04_S03_Integration_E2E_Testing](T04_S03_Integration_E2E_Testing.md)** - *High Complexity*  
  - Implement E2E testing framework (Detox/Cypress) and integration tests for user workflows
  - Depends on T01-T03 for underlying test stability

### ðŸ“± Production Deployment
- **[T05_S03_Mobile_OAuth_Asset_Configuration](T05_S03_Mobile_OAuth_Asset_Configuration.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Configure production signing, OAuth redirects, and app store assets
  - Foundation for mobile deployment

- **[T06_S03_iOS_App_Store_Deployment](T06_S03_iOS_App_Store_Deployment.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - iOS-specific build configuration and App Store submission
  - Depends on T05 for assets and configuration

- **[T07_S03_Android_Play_Store_Deployment](T07_S03_Android_Play_Store_Deployment.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Android-specific build configuration and Google Play Store submission
  - Depends on T05 for assets and configuration

### ðŸ“Š Production Operations  
- **[T08_S03_Production_Monitoring_Analytics](T08_S03_Production_Monitoring_Analytics.md)** - *High Complexity*
  - Implement comprehensive monitoring, error reporting, and analytics
  - Can run in parallel with testing tasks

### ðŸ”’ Final Validation
- **[T09_S03_Production_Security_Audit](T09_S03_Production_Security_Audit.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Comprehensive security audit of authentication, data handling, and API security
  - Requires completion of T01-T08 for full system audit

- **[T10_S03_Performance_Optimization_Load_Testing](T10_S03_Performance_Optimization_Load_Testing.md)** - *Medium Complexity*
  - Performance testing, optimization, and load testing for production readiness
  - Requires T04 and T08 for testing framework and monitoring

- **[T11_S03_Documentation_Quality_Review](T11_S03_Documentation_Quality_Review.md)** - *Low Complexity*
  - Final documentation updates and quality review for M01 completion
  - Should be completed last after all implementation tasks

**Task Dependencies**: T01-T03 (parallel) â†’ T04 â†’ T05 â†’ T06,T07 (parallel), T08 (parallel with T01-T07) â†’ T09,T10 (parallel) â†’ T11 (final)

## Notes / Retrospective Points

**Sprint Focus**: This sprint represents the final phase of M01 completion, transitioning from a functionally complete application to a production-ready system that meets industry quality standards.

**Risk Mitigation**: App store approval processes can be unpredictable; submit early in sprint and prepare for potential resubmission requirements.

**Success Metrics**: This sprint's success will be measured by achieving production-grade quality standards that enable confident scaling and long-term maintainability.

**Post-Sprint**: Upon completion, the project will be ready to transition to M02 (Trip Tracking Core) with a solid, well-tested foundation.
