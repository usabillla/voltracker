# Task: Integration & End-to-End Testing Framework

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration tests and end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for VolTracker to ensure reliable user workflows across web and mobile platforms. This task focuses on testing critical user journeys, Tesla OAuth integration flow, cross-platform navigation patterns, and component interactions to guarantee production readiness.

The current codebase has basic Jest unit testing setup but lacks integration and E2E tests for user workflows. With the app's cross-platform nature (React Native for mobile, React Native Web for web) and complex Tesla OAuth flow, comprehensive testing is essential for production deployment.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust testing foundation that validates user workflows and system integrations across platforms:
- Implement E2E testing framework with platform-specific tools (Detox for mobile, Cypress/Playwright for web)
- Create integration tests for critical user journey flows (login → dashboard → vehicle management → Tesla OAuth)
- Validate cross-platform navigation patterns and screen transitions
- Test Tesla OAuth callback flow and vehicle data synchronization
- Ensure component interactions work correctly across different screen sizes and platforms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] E2E testing framework is configured for both mobile (Detox) and web (Cypress or Playwright)
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete user workflows from login to vehicle management
- [ ] Tesla OAuth flow is fully tested including callback handling and error scenarios
- [ ] Cross-platform navigation testing validates Router.tsx and NavigationContext functionality
- [ ] Screen component tests verify proper rendering and interactions for all major screens
- [ ] Test coverage includes error handling and edge cases for authentication and Tesla integration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
- [ ] Test documentation with clear setup and execution instructions

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research and select E2E testing tools (Detox for mobile, Cypress/Playwright for web)
- [ ] Configure E2E testing environment and setup scripts
- [ ] Implement core user journey tests:
  - [ ] Authentication flow (login → signup → forgot password)
  - [ ] Dashboard navigation and Tesla connection workflow
  - [ ] Vehicle list → vehicle detail navigation
  - [ ] Tesla OAuth complete flow with callback handling
- [ ] Create integration tests for component interactions:
  - [ ] NavigationContext with Router.tsx integration
  - [ ] Tesla service integration with UI components
  - [ ] Screen transitions and state management
- [ ] Implement cross-platform testing strategies:
  - [ ] Web browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - [ ] Mobile platform testing (iOS/Android simulators)
  - [ ] Responsive design validation
- [ ] Add error scenario testing:
  - [ ] Network failures during Tesla OAuth
  - [ ] Invalid authentication states
  - [ ] Vehicle data loading failures
- [ ] Configure test automation and CI/CD integration
- [ ] Create comprehensive test documentation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### User Journey Flows Identified
Based on codebase analysis, critical user journeys to test:

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Login screen → Dashboard (authenticated state)
   - Signup screen → Email verification → Dashboard
   - Forgot password → Reset flow → Login

2. **Tesla Integration Workflow**:
   - Dashboard → "Connect Tesla Account" → OAuth redirect
   - Tesla OAuth callback → TeslaCallback.tsx → Token exchange
   - Vehicle list population → Vehicle selection → Dashboard update

3. **Vehicle Management Flow**:
   - Dashboard → "Manage Vehicles" → VehicleListScreen
   - Vehicle selection → VehicleDetailScreen
   - Vehicle status updates and refresh functionality

4. **Navigation Patterns**:
   - Router.tsx route handling for authenticated/unauthenticated states
   - NavigationContext.tsx cross-platform navigation
   - URL handling for web platform (browser back/forward)

### Key Components to Test

**Screen Components**:
- `LoginScreen.tsx` - Form validation and authentication
- `DashboardScreen.tsx` - Tesla connection status and vehicle display
- `VehicleListScreen.tsx` - Vehicle list rendering and selection
- `VehicleDetailScreen.tsx` - Vehicle data display and actions
- `TeslaCallback.tsx` - OAuth callback processing

**Navigation Components**:
- `Router.tsx` - Route switching based on auth state and current route
- `NavigationContext.tsx` - Platform-specific navigation and URL handling

**Integration Points**:
- Tesla OAuth flow: `connectTesla()` → OAuth redirect → callback → token storage
- Vehicle data sync: Tesla API → local state → UI updates
- Cross-platform navigation: Web URLs ↔ Native navigation

### E2E Testing Framework Setup

**Mobile Testing (React Native)**:
```javascript
// Detox configuration for iOS/Android
// Test Tesla OAuth flow with deep linking
// Validate native navigation patterns
```

**Web Testing (React Native Web)**:
```javascript
// Cypress/Playwright for browser automation
// Test responsive design across screen sizes
// Validate web-specific features (URL handling, browser back/forward)
```

**Cross-Platform Test Patterns**:
```javascript
// Shared test scenarios that run on both platforms
// Platform-specific adaptations for navigation and OAuth
// Responsive design validation
```

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Complete login/signup flows with Supabase
   - Session persistence and restoration
   - Error handling for network failures

2. **Tesla OAuth Integration**:
   - OAuth initiation and redirect handling
   - Callback URL parsing and token exchange
   - Vehicle data fetching and storage
   - Error scenarios (denied access, network failures)

3. **Navigation Integration**:
   - Route transitions with state preservation
   - Browser history management (web)
   - Deep linking support (mobile)

4. **Component Interactions**:
   - Screen-to-screen data passing
   - State updates triggering UI changes
   - Loading states and error handling

### Success Metrics
- All critical user journeys have automated E2E test coverage
- Tesla OAuth flow has 100% scenario coverage (success, failure, edge cases)
- Cross-platform tests validate consistent behavior between web and mobile
- Test execution time remains under 15 minutes for full suite
- Test flakiness rate below 5%
- Clear test failure reporting with actionable debug information
