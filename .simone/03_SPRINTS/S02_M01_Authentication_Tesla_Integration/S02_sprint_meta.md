# Sprint: Authentication & Tesla Integration (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Implement complete authentication system including Supabase user auth and Tesla OAuth integration with secure cross-platform credential storage

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Supabase email authentication flow with signup/login/logout
- Tesla OAuth implementation for all platforms (iOS/Android/Web)  
- Vehicle selection and management interface
- Secure token storage and session management per platform
- Basic vehicle data display and connectivity verification
- Cross-platform authentication state management

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can register, login, and logout using email/password authentication
- Users can connect their Tesla account via OAuth on all platforms
- App successfully retrieves and displays basic vehicle information
- Authentication tokens are securely stored per platform requirements
- Authentication state persists across app restarts
- All authentication flows work consistently across iOS, Android, and Web
- Tesla API connectivity is verified and basic vehicle data is displayed
- Error handling and loading states for all authentication flows

## Sprint Tasks

### Task List (4 tasks, Medium complexity)
1. **TX01_S02** - Supabase Authentication Implementation (Complexity: Medium)
   - Complete email authentication flow with signup/login/logout
   - Cross-platform session management and persistence
   - Form validation and error handling

2. **T02_S02** - Tesla OAuth Integration (Complexity: Medium)
   - Tesla Fleet API OAuth implementation for all platforms
   - Secure token storage and automatic refresh
   - Cross-platform redirect handling

3. **T03_S02** - Vehicle Management Interface (Complexity: Medium)
   - Vehicle selection and management UI
   - Vehicle data display and connectivity verification
   - Database integration and state management

4. **T04_S02** - Cross-Platform Security (Complexity: Medium)
   - Platform-specific secure token storage
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - API security and error boundaries

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Tesla OAuth redirect handling differs between platforms - ensure consistent UX
- Web platform OAuth uses browser redirects, mobile uses deep links
- Consider offline authentication state for better UX
- Implement proper error boundaries for authentication failures
