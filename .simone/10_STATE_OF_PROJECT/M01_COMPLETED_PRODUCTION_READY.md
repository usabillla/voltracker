```

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- React Native 0.79.2 with React 19.0.0
- TypeScript for type safety
- Webpack for web bundling
- React Native Web for cross-platform support

### Backend Services
- Supabase for authentication and database
- Tesla Fleet API for vehicle data
- Row Level Security for data isolation

### Security Measures
- HTTPS enforcement
- Tesla public key cryptographic verification
- RLS policies for user data isolation
- Environment variable separation

## Deployment Status

### Ready for Production âœ…
- **Files**: All production files built and ready
- **Location**: `/web-build/` directory contains deployable assets
- **Size**: ~680KB total bundle size
- **Configuration**: All environment variables set for production

### Deployment Requirements
1. Upload `web-build/*` files to www.voltracker.com server
2. Ensure index.html serves as default page
3. Verify HTTPS and SSL certificate functionality
4. Test complete user flow end-to-end
