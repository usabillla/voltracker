# Project Manifest: VolTracker

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**VolTracker** is a multi-platform mileage tracking application for Tesla vehicles that automatically detects trips, classifies them for tax purposes, and generates IRS-compliant mileage logs. The app targets iOS, Android, and Web platforms using React Native + React Native Web for 85-90% code reuse.

**Core Value Proposition:** Eliminate manual mileage tracking for Tesla owners while ensuring tax compliance and maximizing deduction opportunities.

This project follows a milestone-based development approach with an 8-week MVP timeline.
